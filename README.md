# Limbic: Author-Based Sentiment Aspect Modeling Regularized with Word Embeddings and Discourse Relations

This repo houses a Java implementation of Limbic. Limbic is an unsupervised probabilistic model that addresses the
problem of discovering aspects and sentiments and associating them with authors
of opinionated texts. Limbic combines three ideas, incorporating authors,
discourse relations, and word embeddings. For discourse relations, Limbic
adopts a generative process regularized by a Markov Random Field. To promote
words with high semantic similarity into the same topic, Limbic captures
semantic regularities from word embeddings via a generalized PÃ³lya Urn
process.
